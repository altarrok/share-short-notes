# Technical Requirements Document

## Project: Simple Web Application for Creating and Sharing Short Notes

### Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a simple web application that allows users to create and share short notes. The application will provide features for user authentication, creating, editing, and deleting notes, sharing notes, searching notes, tagging notes, sorting notes, archiving notes, collaboration, reminders, access control, and exporting notes.

1. **User Authentication and Registration**
    - Users can register for an account with a valid email and password
    - Users can log in with a registered email address and correct password
    - Users see an error message if they try to register with an already registered email or an invalid email address
    - Users see an error message if they try to log in with an incorrect email or password

2. **Create Notes**
    - Logged-in users can create a new note with a title and content
    - Notes are saved to the user's account

3. **Edit Notes**
    - Logged-in users can edit the title and content of an existing note
    - Changes are saved to the user's account

4. **Delete Notes**
    - Logged-in users can delete an existing note
    - The note is removed from the user's account

5. **Share Notes**
    - Logged-in users can share notes using a unique URL or by email
    - Users (logged-in or not) with the unique URL can view the shared note

6. **Search Notes**
    - Logged-in users can search for notes by title, content, or tags
    - The application returns a list of notes matching the search criteria

7. **Tag Notes**
    - Logged-in users can add, remove, or edit tags associated with a note
    - Users can filter notes by specific tags

8. **Sort Notes**
    - Logged-in users can sort notes by title, date created, date modified, or tags
    - Notes are displayed according to the selected sorting criteria

9. **Archive Notes**
    - Logged-in users can archive and unarchive notes
    - Users can view a list of archived notes

10. **Collaboration**
    - Logged-in users can invite collaborators to edit notes by email
    - Users can accept collaboration invitations, and the shared note is added to their list of notes
    - Logged-in users can remove collaborators from a note

11. **Reminders**
    - Logged-in users can set, edit, or remove reminders for notes
    - Users receive notifications at the specified date and time of the reminder
    - Users can view a list of all their reminders

12. **Access Control**
    - Logged-in users can set the access level for a note (private, public, or collaborators only)
    - Users can view public notes without logging in
    - Users can view shared notes if they have the appropriate permissions

13. **Export Notes**
    - Logged-in users can export notes as PDF, plain text, or a ZIP file containing multiple notes
    - Users can download the exported files

### Technical Stack

The application will be developed as a web application using the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern web framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js
- Backend: A server-side language or framework like Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails
- Database: A database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB for storing user data and notes

### Security Considerations

- User input must be validated and sanitized on both the client and server side to prevent SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security vulnerabilities
- Secure connections (HTTPS) should be used to encrypt data transmission between the client and server
- Proper access control mechanisms should be in place to ensure that users can only access and modify their own notes and shared notes they have permission to edit

### Performance Considerations

- The application should be optimized for fast loading times and smooth user interactions
- Database queries should be optimized to reduce the time taken to fetch data
- Proper caching mechanisms should be implemented to reduce server load and improve response times
- Pagination or infinite scrolling should be considered for displaying large lists of notes

### Accessibility Considerations

- The application should be designed following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that it is accessible to users with disabilities
- The user interface should be compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies
- All user interface components should be navigable using a keyboard, with clear focus indicators
- Text should have sufficient contrast against its background to ensure readability
- Proper use of headings, labels, and ARIA attributes should be employed to improve the overall accessibility of the application

### Localization and Internationalization

- The application should be designed with localization and internationalization in mind, allowing for easy translation of the user interface into different languages
- Date and time formats should be adaptable to the user's locale
- Consideration should be given to right-to-left (RTL) languages in the design of the user interface

### Testing

- Unit tests should be written for all critical functionality to ensure the application behaves as expected
- Integration tests should be implemented to test the interaction between different components and subsystems
- End-to-end tests should be used to simulate real user interactions and test the overall functionality of the application
- Load and stress tests should be performed to ensure the application can handle a large number of users and requests

### Deployment

- The application should be deployed on a reliable hosting platform, with automated deployment and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place
- Proper monitoring and logging should be implemented to track application performance, errors, and security incidents
- Regular backups of user data should be taken to prevent data loss in case of server failure or other incidents

### Maintenance and Support

- Regular updates should be performed to ensure the application's dependencies and libraries are up-to-date and secure
- A dedicated support team should be available to address user feedback, bug reports, and feature requests
- A knowledge base or documentation should be created and maintained to assist users in understanding how to use the application effectively
- Performance and usage metrics should be collected and analyzed to identify areas for improvement and optimize the user experience
- Regular code reviews and refactoring should be performed to maintain code quality and ensure that the application remains maintainable and scalable over time

### Future Enhancements

- Consider implementing a mobile application for iOS and Android platforms to provide users with a seamless note-taking experience across devices
- Integrate with third-party services and platforms, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote, to allow users to import and export notes easily
- Add advanced text formatting and rich media support to enhance the note-taking experience
- Implement a versioning system for notes, allowing users to view and restore previous versions of their notes
- Add support for real-time collaboration, enabling multiple users to edit a note simultaneously
